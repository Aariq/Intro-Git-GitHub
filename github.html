                    <p>GitHub is an easy way to collaborate with others on shared git repositories. GitHub will host it for us, and we can then sync our local copies with changes made and pushed to the share one.</p>
                    
                    <p>It's also kind of a standard now...</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>SO--does everyone have a GitHub account?</li>
                            <ul><li>If not, please go ahead and <a href="https://github.com/join?source=header-home">make one</a>.</li>
                                <li>If yes, please <a href="https://github.com/login?return_to=%2Fjoin%3Fsource%3Dheader-home">sign in</a>!</li></ul>
                        <li>Raise your blue stickie when you are done.</li>
