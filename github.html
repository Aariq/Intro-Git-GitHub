                    <p>GitHub is an easy way to collaborate with others on shared Git repositories. GitHub will host it for us, and we can then sync our local copies with changes made and pushed to the shared one.</p>
                    
                    <p>It's also the number one website for "social coding" and collaboration now...</p>

                     <p>Git calls copying a remote repository to your local computer <mark>cloning</mark>. When you make a new repository, it comes with these instructions: </p>

                  <p>In our case, since we already have a Git repository initialized, we just want to link it with the one hosted on GitHub -- this is called a <mark>remote</mark> in Git, with the default one called 'origin'.<br>
                  So run the following:</p>
                     
                    <pre><code>
git remote add origin LINK
                    </pre></code>
                    
                    <p>Now, we have to PUSH all our locally created content to the origin remote.</p>

                    <p>Now that we've added the link to our central repository to our local one, we have to <mark>push</mark> all our newly added content.</p>
                     
                    <p>This adds 1 more step to what you already know how to do:</p>
                     
                    <pre><code>
cd repository-name # navigate to your repository
git add -A # shortcut to stage all your files

					<p>A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.</p>
										
					<p>A pull request is when you want to integrate the changes you made into the original repository you forked. You describe the changes you made and make sure your changes don't conflict with the original repo's code.</p>
